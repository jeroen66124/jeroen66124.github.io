_Using the Chirpy theme for Jekyll to create a modern blog_

> This guide provides basic instructions on how to create a Jekyll blog, hosted with GitHub Pages, while using the Chirpy theme. If you want to use any other theme, you can browse them at [Jekyll Themes](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/), but be aware that instructions may differ

## Introduction
The information below will cover creating a clean and preconfigured Windows image, that (if correctly maintained) can save lots of time and reduce resources. It can be applied to both virtual and host machines, and is catered towards people who like to tinker with Windows installations and strip stuff out that is not needed. Most people are fine with either an post-install debloat tool or LTSC versions of Windows, but NTLite can go way deeper than that. 

## Prerequisites
Here's what you'll need to get started:
- [x] Domain name
- [x] GitHub account
- [x] DNS knowledge
- [x] Markdown knowledge

## Step 1: Set up Chirpy
1. Sign in to GitHub and use [this link](https://github.com/cotes2020/chirpy-starter/generate) to generate a new repository based on the Chirpy template

## Step 3: Writing your first blog post

## Closing

Awesome, you're set! NTLite is a really handy tool to tweak every layer of Windows and customize it to your liking. By following this guide, you can create your own Windows image and have a clean installation always ready to go.
