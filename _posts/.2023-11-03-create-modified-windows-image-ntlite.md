_Using NTLite to remove unneeded App components_

> This guide will be written for Windows 10 and 11, but can be applied to all future Windows Operating Systems, compatible with NTLite, PowerShell and the Windows Package Manager. Keep in mind that this guide is just a proof of concept, **do not use it in production**. The steps can be adjusted to your liking, and should include enough information for it to be pretty straight-forward.

## Introduction
The information below will cover creating a clean and preconfigured Windows image, that (if correctly maintained) can save lots of time and reduce resources. It can be applied to both virtual and host machines, and is catered towards people who like to tinker with Windows installations and strip stuff out that is not needed. Most people are fine with either an post-install debloat tool or LTSC versions of Windows, but NTLite can go way deeper than that. 

## Prerequisites
Here's what you'll need to get started:
- [x] Windows 10 or 11 ISO
- [x] NTLite (Free, non-commercial)
- [x] Virtualized Environment (for testing)

## Step 1: Set up NTLite
1. [Download](https://www.ntlite.com/download/) and Install NTLite, the Free version works just fine
