> This guide will be written for Windows 10 and 11, but can be applied to all future Windows Operating Systems, compatible with PowerShell and the Windows Package Manager. Keep in mind that the code of the script is just a proof of concept, or template, if you will. It can be modified to your liking and includes comments for easier understanding, although it is pretty straight-forward on its own.

## Introduction
I mess around with Virtual Machines alot, which also means creating a clean Windows template is part of the process. I do not want to bother with reinstalling Windows everytime I want to try something out in a isolated environment. This script is for the rare occassion when I do end up reinstalling Windows, and want to save as much time as possible. Microsoft has developed the Windows Sandbox feature, which provides a lightweight desktop environment to safely run applications in isolation. This option has one drawback though, it does not have persistency (this has been added in later Windows 11 updates, but I run Windows 10 and do not have the intention to switch anytime soon).

## Prerequisites
Here's what you'll need to get started:
- [x] Windows 10 or 11
- [x] PowerShell (Administrator)

## Step 1: Run the script and evaluate

1.  Start by visiting the official RPCS3 download page at
2.  

## Step 2: Customize the script to your preference

## Closing
