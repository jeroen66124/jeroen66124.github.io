### Hi 👋

I'm Jeroen, a **System Administrator** working at [ITQ](https://itq.eu) 🧡 I have passion for all things IT, but currently focused on Virtualization (mainly [VMware](https://www.vmware.com/products.html?resource=product-listing%3Aanywhere-workspace)), scripting and Internal IT 👨‍💻 I spend my free time developing websites and building small do-it-yourself side projects, which are mostly related (but not limited) to self-hosting, IoT and Bitcoin stuff 🤓

Feel free to check out my past side projects by exploring the [archives](https://vskills.nl/archives/) tab 🗃️
